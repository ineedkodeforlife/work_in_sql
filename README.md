The online store sells books. Each book has a title, is written by the same author, belongs to the same genre, and has a certain price. The store has several copies of each book in stock.

The buyer registers on the website of the online store, sets his first and last name, e-mail and city of residence. He can form one or several orders, write some wishes for each order. Each order includes one or more books, each book can be ordered in multiple copies. Then the order goes through a series of successive stages (operations): it is paid for, packed, handed over to the courier or transport company for transportation, and finally delivered to the buyer. The date of each transaction is recorded. For each city, the average delivery time for books is known.



At the same time, the store keeps a record of books, when buying, their number decreases, when the goods arrive, it increases, when the quantity is exhausted, an order is placed, etc.
